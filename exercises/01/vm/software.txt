- Haven't used a VM but instead a openstack based VPS with a cloud-init ubu 22 LTS
- SSH key got automatically deployed via cloud-init cfg
- But I did standard hardening: SSH only, no default user acc, no root access...
- I forked hpda-samples[1] to make the scripts more resistant

- At first, I couldn't connect although my security group allowed ingoing 8888 TCP from any IP
- A curl on localhost worked, so the server worked as well
- `python3 -m http.server 8888` was accessible externally, so I actually had to config the jupyter...
- weirdly, `jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888` didnt work either
- So I generated a config `jupyter notebook --generate-config`
- Confed it up
  - `c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*'`
  - `c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'`
- Still didnt work.
- I am a idiot, I used the internal private class 2 address... jupyter Works

- Will continue once I got an answer from the supervisors
